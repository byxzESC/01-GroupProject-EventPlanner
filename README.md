## Description

[Visit the deployed site here](https://byxzesc.github.io/01-GroupProject-EventPlanner/)

Search any major city for a Ticketmaster event, such as Sporting events, Music concerts and more. You can filter your search by genre and date range. On the event cards you will see the name of the event, the date of the event, a price range for tickets and a more "More Info" button. You can click on the event card to widen it and display the predicted weather for that event, up to 300 days in the future. Once you have found an event you can click on the "More Info" button to take you to the ticketmaster website to find seating and ticket availabilites.

## Learning Points

During this project I gained experience calling on a server side API and dynamically displaying the parsed information to the page. The building of this app also called to dig into technical documentation to understand how to utilize the API.
